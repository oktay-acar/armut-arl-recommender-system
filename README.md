# Association Rule Based Recommender System using [Armut](https://armut.com/)'s Dataset

**Business Problem**

**Armut**, TÃ¼rkiye's largest online service platform, brings together service providers and those who want to receive service.
It provides easy access to services such as cleaning, modification and transportation with a few touches on your computer or smart phone.

It is desired to create a product recommendation system with **Association Rule Learning** by using the dataset containing the service users and the services and categories these users have received.

**Dataset Story**

The dataset consists of the services customers receive and the categories of these services. It contains the date and time information of each service received.

**Variables**
- **UserId:** Customer ID
- **ServiceId:** Anonymized services belonging to each category 
*(Example: Sofa washing service under the cleaning category)*
A **ServiceId** can be found under different categories and refers to different services under different categories.
*(Example: The service with **CategoryId** 7 and **ServiceId** 4 is honeycomb cleaning, while the service with **CategoryId** 2 and **ServiceId** 4 is furniture assembly)*
- **CategoryId:** Anonymized categories 
*(Example: Cleaning, transportation, renovation category)*
- **CreateDate:** The date the service was purchased
